# Token-Ring-Simulation

# Description
This project simulates a Token Ring network protocol, where a token circulates between 10 computers, enabling communication among them. Each computer has a randomly generated IP and can send messages to another computer in the network.


# Features
Random generation of IP addresses for each computer

Random selection of a source and destination computer

Message transmission using a token that circulates within the network

Display of the token's path and each computer's buffer content
